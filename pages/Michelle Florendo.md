<h3><strong>Founder @ 3Pumpkins</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shiyun-lin-1b4346196/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Shiyun</a> has
a deep interest in understanding what makes a happy life. By spending most
of her time interacting with the community, she enjoys learning the insights
of human joy and suffering, and what can be done for people to live more
happily. She founded 3Pumpkins to explore how social relations can be transformed
and strengthened through socially-engaged arts. Her re-imagination of a
village of care for children is materialised in Tak Takut Kids Club (TTKC),
a children community club located in Boon Lay that anchors an intergenerational
and inter-agency social support system in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shiyun resides in Quantedge Foundationâ€™s Philanthropreneur-in-Residence
(PIR) programme that incubates social sector champions to advance social
mobility in Singapore. She is also a mother of an 11-year-old child.&nbsp;</p>
