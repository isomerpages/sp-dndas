<h4><strong>Founding Principal &amp; CEO @ MIG</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-iacofano-3a06335/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Daniel Iacofano</a> (Ph.D.,
FAICP, FASLA) is internationally recognized as an innovator and thought
leader in urban planning and design, strategic planning, organizational
development, facilitation, and consensus building. His career is as multifaceted
as the field he chose to pursue and the firm he helped co-found. The breadth
of planning not only encompasses everything he enjoys, it enables him to
do what he does best—engage others in creative problem-solving to improve
people’s lives.</p>
<p>From policy- and place-making to systems and structures, Daniel has worked
with hundreds of communities and organizations around the world to think
strategically and critically about achieving desired change. No matter
what the project entails—restoring a river, developing a downtown, or repurposing
a public agency—his comfort with complexity and his dexterity with details
enables him to guide clients through the process of evaluation, decision-making
and implementation.</p>
<p>The management, facilitation, and listening skills he has honed over three
decades enable him to readily assess needs and identify a path forward.
Regardless of the size, shape or current state of a project, Daniel will
always “push the quality envelope” and seek innovation in arriving at solutions.
He delivers the best outcomes possible within given constraints and against
sometimes opposing forces. With his extensive range of experience and expertise
in physical, environmental, and strategic planning, clients and communities
across the nation often find that his impact lasts well beyond his involvement.</p>
