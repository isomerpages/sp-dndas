Cesar serves as a Trustee of the <a href="https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/leadership" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">board of HBKU</a> (Qatar),

<p>Cesar spearheads the "<a href="https://www.notion.so/Climate-Data-Safe-Hackathon-0-Concept-Dec-27-28-Online-1695957ed59a8054abc9d4b97043ddb6?pvs=21" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Climate Data Safe</a>"
initiative, a project to preserve climate data. As climate change increasingly
shapes our environment, health, and economies, it has become a politically
charged issue. Some regions have witnessed censorship of global warming
discussions, defunding of climate science, and destruction of critical
climate data. “Climate Data Safe” aims to decentralise climate data, making
it more accessible, reliable, and sustainable for the future. The initiative
operates under <a href="https://safecast.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Safecast</a>,
a Citizen Science NGO that gained recognition for empowering communities
to monitor radioactivity following the Fukushima nuclear disaster.&nbsp;</p>
