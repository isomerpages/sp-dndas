<p><strong>Day-1 Topic: Using HCD+ to reposition designers through education to become facilitators of change in business, community and planet.</strong>
</p>
<p>How can we prepare designers to become changemakers, not just in creative
industries but across business, community and sustainability? Day 1 explores
how HCD+ transforms education into a catalyst for systems thinking, empathy
and leadership. More than technical training, design education becomes
a foundation for purpose-driven action. By embedding HCD+ into learning
pathways, we nurture a new generation of designers equipped to challenge
norms, lead with values and drive meaningful transformation across society.</p>
