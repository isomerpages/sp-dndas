<p><strong>Day-3 Topic: Using HCD+ to redesign society to be more inclusive, empowered, innovative and creative for the collective good of humanity.</strong>
</p>
<p>How might we reimagine society to be more inclusive, empowered and innovative,
not for individuals alone but for the collective good of humanity? On the
final day of the DNDA Summit, we spotlight how HCD+ can drive systems level
change in the way we live, work and learn. From inclusive design to grassroots
innovation, this day brings together educators, designers, policymakers
and advocates to explore how creativity and design can build a more equitable
and connected world.</p>
<p><strong>Summit Features</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>HCD+ “LEARN”: Gain insights from experts, changemakers, industry leaders
and thought leaders shaping sustainable and inclusive futures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HCD+ “DESIGN”: Shape your own conference experience, contribute to key
discussions, and reflect on how design influences your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HCD+ “CONNECT”: Connect with changemakers, exchange ideas and build new
collaborations in an engaging, purpose-driven environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HCD+ “EXECUTE”: Leave with a clear call to action, including ways to implement
innovation strategies in your organisation or community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unconference: Designed by You</strong>
</p>
<p>The Unconference flips the script by giving the audience control. In this
open, participant-driven segment, attendees propose discussion topics,
form breakout groups, and dive into what matters most to them. Whether
it is sustainability in practice, inclusive design, or the challenges of
driving change in your organisation, this is your space to speak, share
and shape the conversation. Guided by HCD+ values, the Unconference fosters
honest dialogue, active listening and collaborative exchange. It is not
just a session — it is your chance to co-create ideas and connections that
continue beyond the Summit.</p>
