<p><strong>Course Objective</strong>
</p>
<p>The participant-centred programme focuses on supporting individuals in
their sustainability efforts through raising awareness of Environmental,
Social, and Governance (ESG) requirements by utilising a Design Thinking
and Humanity-Centred Innovation (HCI) step by step approach. Through the
framework of people (stakeholders who are impacted, directly or indirectly),
products (innovative products &amp; services) and profits (economic impact
&amp; benefits) participants will gain awareness through a customised plan
for adopting actionable sustainable strategies. The program also helps
participants evaluate their organisation's current sustainability standing,
offering valuable insights and strategies towards Sustainable Business
Innovation and growth.</p>
<p>The course will provide participants with the essential knowledge, awareness,
relevance and responsibilities of corporate sustainability. It will then
identify gaps and how design thinking can be used as a framework in the
transformation process.</p>
