<p>The Gardens feature a range of therapeutic landscapes that enhance the

Designed using evidence-based principles, these landscapes include therapeutic
gardens, nature playgardens, and contemplative landscapes that support
different dimensions of health and well-being.</p>
<p>Through partnerships with various stakeholders and community partners,
Jurong Lake Gardens brings nature-based programmes such as nature walks,

In line with larger national health initiatives that emphasise preventive
