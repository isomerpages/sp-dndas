<p>The Built Environment Transformation Learning Journey (BETLJ), supported
by iBuildSG, is a strategic initiative to help industry participants and
local enterprises understand and adopt the Built Environment Industry Transformation
Map (ITM). It introduces collaboration models and practical approaches
to support transformation across three key areas: Integrated Planning and
Design (IPD), Advanced Manufacturing &amp; Automation (AMA), and Sustainable
Urban Systems (SUS). Through site visits and project showcases, participants
experience innovative practices in design, construction, and facilities
management that enhance business value. BETLJ also highlights Singapore
Polytechnic‚Äôs role in driving transformation through project-based training,
consultancy, and upskilling programs such as Building Information Modelling
(BIM), CORENET X, and Industry Foundation Classes (IFC).</p>
