<p><strong>Audience Shape the Conversation</strong>
</p>
<p>Design Your Conference (DYC) puts the mic in your hands. This isn't your
typical summit segment — it's a bold experiment in co-creation, where <strong>you</strong> help
shape the agenda.</p>
<p>On each day of the DNDA25 Summit, you’ll vote on topics from a curated
list of timely, thought-provoking topics. These aren’t just passive polls
— the results will directly guide live discussions, with keynote speakers
and panellists responding in real time. Think spontaneous debates, fresh
perspectives, and meaningful insights shaped by your curiosity and passion.</p>
<p>DYC runs throughout the Summit, giving you multiple chances to voice your
interests, highlight pressing concerns, and explore what truly matters
to you. Whether it’s human-centred innovation, sustainable design, education
reform or climate action — you get to spotlight the topics that deserve
deeper exploration.</p>
<p><strong>No filters. No fluff. Just real conversations — powered by you.</strong>
