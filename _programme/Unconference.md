<p>The Unconference is a participant-led segment where attendees propose
discussion topics, form breakout groups, and explore what matters most
to them. Unlike traditional sessions, the agenda is shaped on the spot,
allowing for spontaneous and honest conversations.</p>
<p>Held across multiple breakout venues, the Unconference surfaces ideas,
challenges, and perspectives that may not emerge in structured panels.
Guided by HCD+ values, it creates space for meaningful dialogue, active
listening, and shared learning.</p>

<p>The day ends with a moderated fireside chat that gathers key insights
from each group, offering a snapshot of what the community is thinking,
questioning, and working towards through design.</p>
