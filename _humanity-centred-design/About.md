<p><strong>What is Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+)?</strong>
</p>
<p>Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+) is an advanced framework developed by Singapore
Polytechnic’s User Experience Centre. It builds on traditional Human-Centred
Innovation by integrating a deeper focus on holistic well-being, sustainability,
and systemic thinking. HCD+ aims to create innovative solutions that not
only meet user needs but also consider broader social, environmental, and
organisational impacts. This approach reflects the belief that design should
serve humanity as a whole, supporting sustainable progress and ethical
innovation.</p>
<p><strong>The Five Principles of HCD+:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Systems Thinking</strong> – Understanding the interconnectedness
of elements within a system to create solutions that work effectively in
complex environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Holistic Well-Being</strong> – Designing with consideration for
the physical, mental, social, and environmental health of users and communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong> – Prioritising environmentally responsible
practices and long-term impact reduction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-Creation and Inclusivity</strong> – Involving diverse stakeholders
and users actively throughout the design process to ensure equitable outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous Learning and Adaptability</strong> – Encouraging iterative
design, feedback loops, and flexibility to respond to changing needs and
contexts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Application of HCD+: A Case Study:</strong>
</p>
<p>An exemplar of HCD+ in practice is Singapore Polytechnic’s own development
of the HCD+ Playbook, a practical guide for organisations aiming to embed
Humanity-Centred innovation in their culture and processes. Through co-creation
workshops, the User Experience Centre collaborated with various stakeholders—including
industry partners, academic experts, and end-users—to refine the framework.
This inclusive approach ensured the Playbook addressed real challenges,
from sustainability to user experience, enabling organisations to assess
their innovation readiness and implement human-centred, systemic solutions
effectively. The success of this initiative highlights HCD+’s capacity
to drive impactful, responsible innovation across sectors.</p>
