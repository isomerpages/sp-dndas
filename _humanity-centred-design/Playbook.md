<h3><strong>HCD+ Innovation Playbook</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>HCD+ Innovation Playbook</strong> by Singapore Polytechnic’s
User Experience Centre (SP UXC) is a pioneering guide that reimagines design
beyond individuals to include the collective wellbeing of humanity and
the planet. HCD+, short for <strong>Humanity-Centred Design</strong>, builds
on the foundations of traditional Human-Centred Design (HCD) but introduces
a deeper, more sustainable lens — integrating social equity, systems thinking,
and environmental responsibility into every stage of innovation.</p>
<p>This playbook is inspired by the visionary work of <strong>Professor Don Norman</strong>,
who advocates for a shift from designing <em>for users</em> to designing <em>for humanity</em>.
SP UXC’s framework puts this into action through a five-stage process: <strong>Envision, Empathise, Create, Evaluate, and Deliver</strong>.
Unlike conventional design guides, it’s not just about creating usable
products, but about transforming organisations and individuals into <strong>agents of sustainable change</strong>.</p>
<p>At the heart of the HCD+ approach are <strong>five core sustainable innovation principles</strong>:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Systems Thinking</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Holistic Wellbeing</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bioinspiration</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Circularity</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Equity &amp; Inclusion</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, the playbook calls for <strong>six critical mindset shifts</strong>,
such as expanding empathy to all living things and adopting long-term perspectives.</p>
<p>Designed for practitioners, leaders, educators, and students, the HCD+
Playbook offers practical methods, tools, and strategies to foster meaningful,
inclusive innovation. It encourages readers to address real-world constraints
like cost, resources, and resistance to change, by framing them as opportunities
for creativity and collaboration.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is more than a guide — it’s a call-to-action to <strong>design for People, Planet, Product, and Profit (the 4Ps)</strong>.
SP UXC invites all changemakers to join the HCD+ movement and co-create
a future where humanity and nature thrive together.</p>
