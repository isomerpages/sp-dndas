<h3><strong>Our Partners </strong></h3>
<p>These collaborations create opportunities for knowledge-sharing, networking,
and fostering innovative solutions that address global challenges. By uniting
diverse stakeholders, the summit empowers early-career practitioners and
educators to explore sustainable design practices and contribute to a more
equitable future. Through these partnerships, the DNDA Summit amplifies
the influence of HCD+, creating a global movement dedicated to designing
for humanity, culture, and the environment.</p>
