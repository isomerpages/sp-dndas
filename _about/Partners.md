<h3><strong>Our Partners</strong></h3>
<p>These collaborations create opportunities for knowledge exchange, build
lasting connections and spark innovative solutions to global challenges.
By bringing together diverse stakeholders, the Summit supports early-career
practitioners and educators in exploring sustainable design and contributing
to a more equitable future. Through these partnerships, the DNDA Summit
amplifies the influence of Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+), strengthening
a global movement dedicated to designing for humanity, culture, and the
environment.</p>
