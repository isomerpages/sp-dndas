<p>The Don Norman Design Award (DNDA) Summit celebrates the power of Humanity-Centred
Design (HCD+), spotlighting projects that contribute meaningfully to the
United Nationsâ€™ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It showcases the
work of early-career practitioners, explores productive failures, and shares
strategies for real-world impact.</p>
<p>At its core, HCD+ is about long-term societal well-being. It blends social
responsibility with innovative thinking to meet human needs, support viable
business models, and build environmental resilience. Together, these principles
shape a more equitable and sustainable future.re.</p>
<p>The DNDA25 Summit brings these ideas to life through four interconnected
goals, each informed by the HCD+ approach:</p>
<p><strong>1. Empowering Education</strong>
</p>
<p>HCD+ nurtures a mindset that tackles root causes, not just symptoms. It
promotes systems thinking, encourages consideration for the environment
and all living beings, and prioritises human values over technological
or financial gain. At every level of education, students are empowered
to create meaningful change:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Primary education introduces young learners to design thinking by encouraging
them to solve problems they observe in their everyday lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary education deepens this by helping students explore the systemic
nature of global challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tertiary education immerses students in real-world projects, often in
collaboration with industry and government.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</strong>
</p>
<p>Effective infrastructure underpins a well-functioning society. For innovation
to succeed, it needs both government support and thoughtful design. HCD+
offers practical insights into how infrastructure and innovation can be
developed together, ensuring solutions are sustainable, people-centred
and impactful.</p>
<p><strong>3. Sustainable Cities and Communities</strong>
</p>
<p>As climate change intensifies, communities must be designed for both sustainability
and resilience. HCD+ enables more inclusive approaches to infrastructure,
urban policy and community planning, helping cities thrive while addressing
the needs of their most vulnerable populations.</p>
<p><strong>4. Climate Action</strong>
</p>
<p>Meaningful climate action requires alignment across education, infrastructure
and policy. By placing human values at the centre of strategy and design,
HCD+ guides the creation of sustainable business models and policy responses
that can endure over time, advancing both environmental and social resilience.</p>
<p><strong>The DNDA25 Summit reflects how HCD+ can shape a future where education, innovation, sustainability and climate action are harmonised to benefit all.</strong>
