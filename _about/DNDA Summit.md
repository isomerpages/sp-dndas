<h4><strong>Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+): The Future of Education, Business &amp; Community</strong></h4>
<p>The DNDA Summit celebrates the power of <strong>Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+)</strong>,
showcasing impactful projects aligned with the UN's 17 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). It highlights the work of early-career practitioners, explores
productive failures, and uncovers strategies for success. HCD+ focuses
on long-term societal well-being and sustainability, merging social responsibility
with innovative solutions to balance human needs, business viability, and
environmental resilience, ultimately shaping a more equitable future.</p>
<p>The <strong>DNDA25 summit</strong> embodies these principles with four interconnected
goals, all benefiting from HCD+ approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Empowering Education</strong>
<br>HCD+ fosters a mindset that addresses root causes rather than just symptoms.
It encourages systems thinking, considering the impact on the environment
and all living beings. HCD+ prioritises societal needs and human values,
with technology and financial considerations secondary to improving quality
of life. These principles empower students across all education levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Primary education</em> allows students to design solutions for problems
they observe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Secondary education</em> introduces students to deeper, systemic thinking
about the worldâ€™s challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tertiary education</em> engages students in real-world projects in
collaboration with industry and government.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</strong>
<br>Well-designed infrastructure is crucial for the proper functioning of
society. Innovative ideas require robust infrastructure and government
support to become effective. HCD+ approaches offer valuable insights into
the intersection of innovation and infrastructure, ensuring sustainable,
impactful outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sustainable Cities and Communities</strong>
<br>As climate change accelerates, sustainability and resilience are vital.
HCD+ can drive innovative solutions in infrastructure, policy, and urban
planning, helping create communities that thrive amidst environmental challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Climate Action</strong>
<br>Addressing climate change requires coordinated efforts across education,
infrastructure, and policy. HCD+ ensures that human values are central
to creating sustainable business models and governmental strategies, guiding
action towards a resilient future.</p>
<p>The DNDA25 Summit illustrates how <strong>Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+)</strong> can
shape a future where education, innovation, sustainability, and climate
action are harmonised to benefit all.</p>
