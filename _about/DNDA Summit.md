<p>The DNDA Summit celebrates the power of Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+),
showcasing impactful projects aligned with the UN's 17 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). It highlights the work of early-career practitioners, explores
productive failures, and uncovers strategies for success. HCD+ focuses
on long-term societal well-being and sustainability, merging social responsibility
with innovative solutions to balance human needs, business viability, and
environmental resilience, ultimately shaping a more equitable future.</p>
<p>The DNDA25 summit embodies these principles with four interconnected goals,
all benefiting from HCD+ approaches:</p>
<p>1. Empowering Education</p>
<p>HCD+ fosters a mindset that addresses root causes rather than just symptoms.
It encourages systems thinking, considering the impact on the environment
and all living beings. HCD+ prioritises societal needs and human values,
with technology and financial considerations secondary to improving quality
of life. These principles empower students across all education levels:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Primary education allows students to design solutions for problems they
observe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary education introduces students to deeper, systemic thinking about
the worldâ€™s challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tertiary education engages students in real-world projects in collaboration
with industry and government.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</p>
<p>Well-designed infrastructure is crucial for the proper functioning of
society. Innovative ideas require robust infrastructure and government
support to become effective. HCD+ approaches offer valuable insights into
the intersection of innovation and infrastructure, ensuring sustainable,
impactful outcomes.</p>
<p>3. Sustainable Cities and Communities</p>
<p>As climate change accelerates, sustainability and resilience are vital.
HCD+ can drive innovative solutions in infrastructure, policy, and urban
planning, helping create communities that thrive amidst environmental challenges.</p>
<p>4. Climate Action</p>
<p>Addressing climate change requires coordinated efforts across education,
infrastructure, and policy. HCD+ ensures that human values are central
to creating sustainable business models and governmental strategies, guiding
action towards a resilient future.</p>
<p>The DNDA25 Summit illustrates how Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+) can shape
a future where education, innovation, sustainability, and climate action
are harmonised to benefit all.</p>
