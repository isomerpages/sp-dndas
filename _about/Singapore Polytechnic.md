<p>Singapore Polytechnic (SP) has been at the forefront of integrating Humanity-Centred
Design (HCD+) into its educational framework, business collaborations,
and community initiatives. This approach prioritises human well-being,
cultural inclusivity, and environmental sustainability, aligning with the
United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p><strong>Educational Integration of HCD+</strong>
</p>
<p>SP's commitment to HCD+ is evident across its curriculum and pedagogical
strategies. The institution employs design thinking methodologies to cultivate
critical thinking, empathy, and problem-solving skills among students.
Programs such as the Business Essentials Through Action (BETA) Programme
exemplify this integration, offering Year 1 business students hands-on
experience in venture creation and industry mentorship, with a focus on
social impact and ethical entrepreneurship.</p>
<p><strong>Industry Collaboration and Innovation</strong>
</p>
<p>SP's User Experience Centre collaborates with industry partners to tackle
complex challenges using the HCD+ Innovation framework. This multidisciplinary
approach enables the development of sustainable solutions that address
real-world problems . Additionally, SP's Industry &amp; Partnerships division
facilitates co-location opportunities, allowing businesses to work alongside
students and faculty on applied projects, fostering an ecosystem of innovation
and shared learning.</p>
<p><strong>Community Engagement and Global Outreach</strong>
</p>
<p>SP extends its HCD+ philosophy beyond the campus through various community
engagement initiatives. The institution's involvement in international
events, such as the Don Norman Design Award (DNDA) Summit, underscores
its dedication to promoting design as a force for good. By hosting the
DNDA25 Summit in Singapore, SP provides a platform for early-career practitioners,
educators, and changemakers to collaborate and share insights on sustainable
design practices.</p>
<p>Singapore Polytechnic's proactive adoption and promotion of HCD+ principles
reflect its commitment to shaping a future where education, business, and
community development are harmoniously aligned with human-centric and sustainable
values. Through its integrated approach, SP continues to inspire and equip
individuals and organizations to design solutions that are not only innovative
but also ethically responsible and socially impactful.</p>
