<p>At Singapore Polytechnic (SP), HCD+ is central to how we educate, collaborate
and serve. This approach prioritises human well-being, cultural inclusivity
and environmental sustainability, aligning with the United Nations’ SDGs.</p>
<p><strong>Educational Integration of HCD+</strong>
</p>
<p>SP’s commitment to HCD+ is reflected in its curriculum and teaching approach.
By applying design thinking methodologies, students are equipped with critical
thinking, empathy and problem-solving skills. One example is the Business
Essentials Through Action (BETA) programme, which gives Year 1 business
students hands-on experience in venture creation and mentorship, with a
focus on social impact and ethical entrepreneurship.</p>
<p><strong>Industry Collaboration and Innovation</strong>
</p>
<p>SP’s User Experience Centre collaborates with organisations to address
complex challenges using the HCD+ Innovation framework. This multidisciplinary
approach supports the development of sustainable, real-world solutions.
SP’s Industry &amp; Partnerships Department also facilitates co-location
opportunities, where companies work alongside students and staff on applied
projects, creating shared spaces for innovation and learning.</p>
<p><strong>Community Engagement and Global Outreach</strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond campus, SP brings the HCD+ approach into the wider community through
outreach efforts and global platforms. Its involvement in international
events, such as the Don Norman Design Award (DNDA) Summit, reflects SP’s
belief in design as a force for good. By hosting DNDA25 in Singapore, SP
provides a platform for early-career practitioners, educators and changemakers
to exchange ideas and explore sustainable design.</p>
<p>SP’s integration and promotion of HCD+ reflects a broader effort to shape
a future where education, business and communities grow in alignment with
human-centred and sustainable values. Through this integrated approach,
SP continues to inspire and support individuals and organisations to design
solutions that are not only innovative, but also ethically grounded and
socially meaningful.</p>
