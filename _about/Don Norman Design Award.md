<p>The Don Norman Design Award (DNDA) organisation is dedicated to promoting
the global adoption of Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+). DNDA champions holistic
and sustainable design practices that benefit all people, living things,
cultures, and the planet. Through its annual flagship events, the DNDA
Awards Program and Summit, DNDA celebrates groups making significant societal
contributions, rallies leaders to embrace an HCD+ approach to innovation,
and nurtures the development of emerging designers and educators. Founded
in 2023 as a nonprofit organisation, DNDA draws inspiration from the work
of Don Norman, a luminary in the world of design with a distinguished career
as an author, teacher, advisor, and executive at companies such as Apple,
HP, and the Nielsen Norman group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+) builds upon the principles of HCD+, and
emphasises consideration of the impact that design has upon the entire
world with the inclusion of communities as members of the design team.
Human-Centred Design is abbreviated as HCD. Humanity-Centred Design is
HCD plus more: HCD+.</p>
<p>At its core, HCD+ is about long-term societal well-being. It blends social
responsibility with innovative thinking to meet human needs, support viable
business models, and build environmental resilience. Together, these principles
shape a more equitable and sustainable future.</p>
