<p>The Don Norman Design Award (DNDA) organisation is dedicated to promoting
the global adoption of Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+). DNDA champions holistic
and sustainable design practices that benefit both society and the planet.
Through its annual flagship events, the DNDA Awards Program and Summit,
DNDA celebrates groups making significant societal contributions, rallies
leaders to embrace an HCD+ approach to innovation, and nurtures the development
of emerging designers and educators. Founded in 2023 as a U.S. based nonprofit
organisation, DNDA draws inspiration from the work of Don Norman, a luminary
in the world of design with a distinguished career as an author, teacher,
founder, advisor, and executive at renowned companies such as Apple and
HP.</p>
<p>At its core, HCD+ is about long-term societal well-being. It blends social
responsibility with innovative thinking to meet human needs, support viable
business models, and build environmental resilience. Together, these principles
shape a more equitable and sustainable future.</p>
