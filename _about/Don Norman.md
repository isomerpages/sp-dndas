<p>The Don Norman Design Award (DNDA) is a non-profit dedicated to advancing
Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+) worldwide, prioritising the well-being of
humanity, diverse cultures, the environment, and all living beings. Inspired
by Don Norman's work, DNDA honours early-career practitioners and educational
institutions that address community challenges with sustainable, human-centred
solutions.</p>
<p>By focusing on early-career professionals, DNDA provides crucial encouragement
when it’s most needed—at the start of their journey. The annual international
Summit on HCD+ fosters dialogue, learning, and networking, bringing together
practitioners, educators, and changemakers committed to addressing societal
issues aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>DNDA is where design becomes a powerful tool for societal transformation.</p>
